   - Use descriptive branch names
   - Keep branches focused on single features

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run the notebook to ensure it works
   jupyter notebook dl_cnn_imageClassification_CIFAR.ipynb
   
   # Check code style
   black --check .
   flake8 .
   ```

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear description of changes
   - Reference related issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Request reviews from maintainers

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
```python
def train_model(model, train_data, validation_data, epochs=10):
    """
    Train a CNN model on the provided dataset.
    
    Args:
        model: Compiled Keras model
        train_data: Training data tuple (X_train, y_train)
        validation_data: Validation data tuple (X_val, y_val)
        epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 10)
    
    Returns:
        history: Training history object
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

- Test with different datasets

### Example Test Structure
```python
import pytest
import tensorflow as tf
from your_module import your_function

def test_your_function():
    """Test the your_function with various inputs."""
    # Arrange
    input_data = tf.random.normal((10, 32, 32, 3))
    
    # Act
    result = your_function(input_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.shape == (10, 10)  # Expected output shape
    assert tf.reduce_all(tf.greater_equal(result, 0))  # Non-negative values
```
